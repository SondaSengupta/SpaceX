# SpaceX

This repo exposes the launchpad api from Open Space-X Api found [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/launchpad.md)

Why contact the SpaceX-Api directly, when you can work through a middle man?

## Features
- Exposes Get By Launchpad Id
- Filter launchpads by status, partial or whole name, or both.
